# NuShell
Customized Bash Syntax using antlr4

Here's the [blog post explaining more](https://sorensenucsc.github.io/CSE211-fa2023/projects/nushell/index.html):

## FAQ

- Wait, isn't there an *actual* shell named `nushell`?

Yes, there is! It's a really cool project that isn't really related to this. You can look at it [here](https://github.com/nushell/nushell).

- Then, why did you choose this name?

I had never heard of `nushell` until this project was already submitted (to be honest, you can consider them different projects because I wrote the name in camel case), and had stumbled upon it by pure chance a few weeks afterwards. Jokes aside, I thought the prefix "nu-" was cool and I wanted this project to eventually become "new shell". At the moment, however, it isn't really a new shell, since all it does is convert from a customized syntax to bash.

- A Message to the `nushell` devs:
In case you ever want me to rename this project, feel free to email me at `ananthajit5d@gmail.com`! I apologize if this project ever causes issues!
